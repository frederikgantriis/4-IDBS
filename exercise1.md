(c) In a main memory system, it is not necessary to include the “old” values when logging changes made by transactions to secondary storage.
(d) As discussed in a lecture, Google claims to have built a distributed system that offers both consistency and availability in the face of network partitions; this proves that the CAP theorem is wrong.
